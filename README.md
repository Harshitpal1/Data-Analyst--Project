# Data Analyst Project

This repository contains the dataset (Data-set.xlsx) and an exploratory data analysis notebook. As an intern, I added an EDA notebook and requirements to help analyze the dataset.

How to run:
1. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the notebook with Jupyter or execute the script to generate CSV and basic plots.
